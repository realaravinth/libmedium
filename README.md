## Status

Usable. Should you run into a `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error`, please
file a bug report with the URL of the post you were trying to read and
the git commit hash of the build. Git commit hash can be obtained from
[/api/v1/meta/build](https://libmedium.batsense.net/api/v1/meta/build).

This proxy works by interacting with Medium's undocumented(probably
private but unauthenticated) API. So I've had to make assumptions and
tweak API schematics as I run into errors.

## Features

-   [x] proxy images
-   [x] proxy GitHub gists
-   [x] render posts
-   [x] syntax highlighting for gists
-   [ ] user pages(WIP)
-   [ ] RSS feeds

## Why?

Knowledge is the true wealth of humanity. If it weren't for our
ancestors, who chose to pass down their knowledge and experiences, we
would still be a primitive species. Whatever advancement that we as
a species have achieved is because we chose to share information.

To put a paywall on knowledge like that is both obscene and goes against
the very nature of humanity.

It is possible to run a sustainable publication business while still
respecting freedom. [LWN.net](https://lwn.net) is one of my favourite
publications that has been around forever. So it is possible. I hope
medium.com comes up with other, non-harmful ways to run a sustainable
business.
